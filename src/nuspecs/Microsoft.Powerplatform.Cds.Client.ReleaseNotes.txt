++CURRENTRELEASEID++
BREAKING CHANGE!!!
Altering Nuget Version to 3 digit semantic version
Namespace change from Microsoft.Powerplatform.xxxx to Microsoft.PowerPlatform.xxxx
Fixed an error with setting CallerId when ClientSecret Auth type is used.  
    Thanks for all the bug reports on this and repro's that really helped us run it down. 

0.0.1.11-Alpha:
Fixed a number of discovery related issue that were broken during the port. 
Added new forms of DiscoveryGlobalOrganziations to allow for a token function to be passed to enabled this for use in WebSites and functions where it makes sense. 
Updated several sovereign GEO's configs to reflect use of Global discovery for those GEOs
Fixed a bug in LinQ create methods that would appear on non-windows deployments. 
    This would manifest as a missing method exception when trying to create a sequential guid. 

0.0.1.9-Alpha:
Fixes a bug in using ExecuteCdsWebRequest that blocked connections using clientSecretAuth types.

0.0.1.8-Alpha:
Removed IOverrideAuthHookWrapper and property and replaced with a new constructor form. 
    This capability was replaced with a new constructor that accepts a function pointer as a parameter to the constructor. 
    This user provided function takes the form of string FunctionName (string InstanceUri),  When called, the current instance URI will be
    passed in and the function is expected to return an access token for access to that instance.  
    This form allows an given instance of the CdsServiceClient to be associated with a Auth Processor vs having the auth processor at the process level.

Fixed a bug reported in .clone in .net core builds.  When cloning a connection in .net core, the system would think you were using an invalid auth type.

Known issues:
    None at this time.. Please report any issues on the GitHub Issues site.
